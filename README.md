This is a program to help people understand the OS module in python.

It is a one liner with some of the most common file path functions.

There are no packages necessary. Just create a .txt file called data

on your Desktop and run the python script. The python script will read

data.txt and print out stats about the file.

---T O   C A L L---

          Step1. Create an object like this--> file_path_1=file_path("Drive>User/Desktop/folder/file")

          Step2. Call your object like this--> try:
                                                  file_path_1.is_real_file()
                                               except:
                                                  print("file path does not exist)
